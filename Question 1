(10 points) Which route should we pick? Show your work.
Speed(sandy) = 3km/h
Speed(smooth) = 5 km/h
Speed(rocky) = 2 km/h
--> Route1=
       P(sandy) = 0.2
       P(smooth) = 0.3
       P(rocky) = 0.5
       Time(route 1) = 0.2*2/3 + 0.3*2/5 + 0.5*2/2 = 0.133 + 0.12 + 0.5 = 0.75  h

--> Route2=
       P(sandy) = 0.4
       P(smooth) = 0.2
       P(rocky) = 0.4
       Time(route 2) = 0.4*1.8/3 + 0.2*1.8/5 + 0.4*1.8/2 = 0.24 + 0.072 + 0.36 = 0.672 h

--> Route3=
       P(sandy) = 0.5
       P(smooth) = 0.4
       P(rocky) = 0.1
       Time(route 2) = 0.5*3.1/3 + 0.4*3.1/5 + 0.1*3.1/2 = 0.52 + 0.248 + 0.155 = 0.923 h

       We should pick route 2.



P(damagedCrater) = 0.3 will add 0.75 h
P(!damagedCrater)=0.7

Time(route 1) = 0.3*(0.75+0.75) + 0.7*0.75 = 0.45 + 0.525  = 0.975

Time(route 2) = 0.6*(0.672 + 1) + 0.4*0.672 = 1.003 + 0.269 = 1.272

We would chose route 1.


Given: Route 3 is smooth
time(route 3) = 3.1/5 = 0.62

Yes, this information is helpful and we can say that route 3 is fastest.

how long are we willing to wait for this information from the satellite?
--> 0.975 -  0.62 = 0.355h


(5 points) Now put this problem into ChatGPT. Is it able to solve it correctly? If not, where does it make mistakes?
--> for chat GPT - 3.5 version, Choice of route is correct but values are wrong.

From Chat GPT:
Let's dive into these calculations!

**Question 1:**
Route 1: \(0.2 \times 3 + 0.3 \times 5 + 0.5 \times 2 = 0.6 + 1.5 + 1 = 3.1 \text{ km/h}\)
Route 2: \(0.4 \times 3 + 0.2 \times 5 + 0.4 \times 2 = 1.2 + 1 + 0.8 = 3 \text{ km/h}\)
Route 3: \(0.5 \times 3 + 0.4 \times 5 + 0.1 \times 2 = 1.5 + 2 + 0.2 = 3.7 \text{ km/h}\)
So, Route 2 is the fastest without additional information.

**Additional Information:**
Route 1 with the damaged wall: \(3.1 \text{ km/h} + 0.3 \times 45 \text{ min} = 3.1 + 0.15 = 3.25 \text{ km/h}\)
Route 2 with the damaged bridge: \(3 \text{ km/h} + 0.6 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 3 + 0.6 = 3.6 \text{ km/h}\)
Route 3 with potential satellite information: \(3.7 \text{ km/h}\)
So, now Route 1 becomes the fastest with the damaged wall.

**Satellite Information:**

Knowing the terrain in Route 3 would be helpful because it might save time if it's smooth. The value of this information
depends on how much time you're willing to wait. If waiting for the satellite information takes less time than the
potential time saved on Route 3, it's worth waiting.

**Putting it into ChatGPT:**

ChatGPT might struggle with this problem due to its text-based nature and the need for numerical calculations. It could
handle the logic and decision-making aspects if guided properly, but for the quantitative calculations, it might not
perform as accurately as a dedicated calculator or programming environment. You'd need to carefully structure the input
to get meaningful responses from ChatGPT.
