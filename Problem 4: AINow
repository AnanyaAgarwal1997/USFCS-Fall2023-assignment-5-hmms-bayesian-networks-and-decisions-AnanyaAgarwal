What are the three dimensions along which Big Tech has an advantage in AI?
-> The three dimensions along which Big Tech has advantage in AI are:

    Data Advantage: Big Tech firms have deepest data insights through surveillance or acquisition strategies which gives
      an edge in creating consumer AI products. These firms have economic power which enabled them as core infrastructure
      within number of industries.

    Computing Power Advantage: AI being a data-driven enterprise which heavily relies on substantial computing power to
      train, tune and deploy models. This is expensive and runs on material dependencies such as chips and location of
      data centers. Even the new AI startups rely on Big Tech's infrastructure to operate. We see Big Tech companies
      wielding their control over necessary acquisitions to throttle competition.

    Geopolitical Advantage: AI systems are being recast as commercial products as well as strategic and economic assets.
      Due to US-China race, many AI companies leveraged within this geopolitical fight resulting Big Tech companies in
      alignment with US economic prawness ensured resources and political capital to these companies.


Why does AI Now think it's important to focus on Big Tech?
-> AI Now thinks to focus on Big Tech because:

    1. Tackling challenges such as invasive data surveillance, manipulation of individual and collective autonomy,
       consolidation of economic power, inequality, discrimination and others that were exemplified by big tech
       companies address root cause problems of several key concerns.

    2. Big Tech companies' regulatory playbook effects on broader ecosystem which incentivize and compel other companies
        to fall in line. For example: Facebook and Google's adoption of behavioral model of invasive commercial
        surveillance into becoming business model of Internet.

    3. While a whole spectrum of vendors for AI sell to government agencies, the dependency of government for basic
        governance functions over Big Tech due to wider tech ecosystem from cloud computing to advertising makes Big
        Tech, a choking point or single point of failure.


Priority 1 discusses Algorithmic Accountability. What does this mean? Why is it important to shift responsibility for
detecting harm on companies themselves?
--> It is difficult to identify tech-enabled harms.So, we bring in Algorithmic accountability as a policy response and
audit framework on third party evaluation in company's playbook dependent by positioning responsibility for identifying
and addressing harms outside the company.
It is important to shift responsibility for detecting harm on companies themselves because tech sector has unpredictable
effects on our economy, information environment and labor market. It is hard to predict any particular harm these may
cause but consequences are severe and communities that hit hardest are those that already experience significant inequality.


What are the windows for action that are identified? Which do you personally think are the most effective or promising?
--> Following are the windows for action which I believe could be more effective or promising:

    1. Practise Data Minimization - Create policies to limit data collection on consumers or produce data about them.
        Reform merger guidelines and enforcement measures to avoid abusive practises.
    2. Enforce competition laws and integrate competition analysis across all tech policy domains. Pass antitrust bills
        to give anti-trust enforcers stronger tools to challenge abusive practises.
    3. Regulate ChatGPT and other larger models by making documentation as mandatory so as to provide evidence to ensure
        developers are held accountable for data-design choices.
    4. Enact strong curbs on worker surveillance and build future-proof against  quiet expansion of  biometric surveillance.
    5. Prevent "international preemption" by digital trade agreements that can be used to weaken national regulation on
        algorithmic accountability and computation policy.


Do you agree with this assessment? How might we rethink our relationship with AI and with technology in order to avoid
these potential negative outcomes?
--> Yes, I agree with the assessment.
We can rethink our relationship with AI and with technology in order to avoid negative outcomes by ensuring strict
policy reforms especially to put a limit on data collection. We have to change our mindset from diagnosing harms to its
remediation. Since developers of large language models are aware of how AI is working, it is hard for general public to
even imagine what harms can cause by AI. Hence, it becomes responsibility of AI developers to build and implement AI
responsibly and scrutinizing it too post implementation. We have to enact laws on algorithmic transparency and updated
trade agreements should be used to set a more progressive baseline for digital policy. There should be AI ethics teams
in big organization to regulate policies and monitor AI work being done  in Big Tech companies.


Now paste this last question into ChatGPT and include its response. How do you compare its output to your own?
--> ChatGPT answer:
I can see where the concern is coming from. It's true that if we blindly embrace AI without considering its societal
impacts, we might end up reinforcing existing inequalities and facing unforeseen consequences. To avoid these pitfalls,
 we need a balanced approach.

Firstly, fostering awareness is crucial. People need to understand the implications of AI beyond just its technological
aspects. Education can empower individuals to make informed decisions about the use and development of AI.

Regulation is another key element. Striking a balance between innovation and ethical guidelines can help prevent the
misuse of AI and ensure that it benefits society as a whole. It's like having rules on the playground to make sure
everyone has a fair shot.

Lastly, inclusivity is vital. Diverse voices should be involved in the development and decision-making processes related
 to AI. This helps ensure that different perspectives are considered, preventing the technology from unintentionally
 favoring certain groups or perpetuating biases.

 This is a very relatable answer to mine with few differences. It discusses about to not embrace AI blindly and talks
 about regulation. But nothing about which startegy to deploy first to recur for these efforts.
